    				<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    			</div>
    			<p>I'm a computer engineer interested in video games, learning and new technologies. I'm looking for opportunities in these fields, but also in AI, virtual reality, or new media technologies.<br/><br/>

Nowadays, with video games, virtual reality, augmented reality, internet of things... there are plenty of new possibilities to create new experiences. The way people use computers is going to change dramatically, the way people enjoy games, movies or even how they learn things are also going to change. <br/>
I'm passionate about these new possibilities and I want to be part of these changes.</p>
